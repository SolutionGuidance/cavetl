# Credentialing and Verification: Extract, Translate, and Load

This is a standalone open source project meant to support access to
third-party data sources useful for credentialing and vetting health
care providers.  It is a series of microservices, each of which seeks
to answer a specific question about a person's eligibility to provide
healthcare services.

Currently, we provide access to:

 * LEIE Exclusions List
 * Social Security's Death Master File
 
And we have plans for many more, including certifications and PECOS,
as its new access methods develop.

We believe the CAVETL stack has applications in State MMIS systems, to
health care providers screening employees, and to health insurers
vetting in-network providers.  If you see ways to build on CAVETL,
please get in touch with james AT opentechstrategies.com.  We'd love
to help!
