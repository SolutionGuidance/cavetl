## Calling

The API wrapping the LEIE data only has one endpoint: `Exclusion`.  It
takes `GET` requests which may include one or more of the following
query parameters.  These parameters are related to the LEIE's own
columns, which are described by the Treasury Department's [Do Not Pay
documentation
(PDF)](https://donotpay.treas.gov/20160615QRCLEIEFINAL.pdf):

- `npi`: The 9-digit National Provider Identifier (NPI) of a given
  provider.  This is currently what the PSM uses to search LEIE
  results.
- `firstname`: The first name of the excluded provider.
- `midname`: Middle name or initial of the excluded provider (individual
  or entity).  May be empty.
- `lastname`: The last name of the excluded provider.
- `busname`: The business name of the provider.
- `dob`: Excluded individual provider's date of birth, in YYYY-MM-DD
  format.
- `address`: The provider's address.
- `city`: The provider's city.
- `state`: The provider's state (the two-letter abbreviation for the
  United States, not including territories).
- `zip`: The provider's 5-digit zipcode.
- `rowid`: The ID of the exclusion record in the LEIE.
- `excldate`: The date of the exclusion in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- `excltype`: A code from the LEIE that represents the exclusion types
  listed on the [Exclusion
  Authorities](https://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/authorities.asp) page.
- `waiverdate`: Date the individual’s or entity’s exclusion status was
  waived.  See the OIG's [Waivers
  page](https://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/waivers.asp) for more about waivers.
- `waiverstate`: State in which the individual’s or entity’s exclusion
  was waived, again via standard two-letter abbreviation.
- `upin`: The predecessor to the NPI, the [Unique Physician
  Identification
  Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_physician_identification_number).
- `general`: Basic type of medical practice or position of the
  individual or entity being excluded, e.g. "Individual."
- `specialty`: Medical specialization of the individual or entity being
  excluded, e.g. "Nurses aide."
- `reindate`: Date the excluded provider was reinstated, if any.  This
  takes the YYYY-MM-DD format.  See
  the OIG's page about
  [Reinstatement](https://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/reinstatement.asp) for
  more information.

Formatting options:

- `_format`: Preferred return format, either `json` or `xml`, defaulting
  to `json`.  This is a [FHIR
  specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#mime-type).
- `page`: For paginated API results, give a page number and, optionally,
  a `page_size`.  This defaults to 1 (the first page).
- `page_size`: For paginated API results, you may pass the number of
  results to be shown on a page.  This defaults to 15.
